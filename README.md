# react-redux-toolbox-starter

A quick starter using:
* [Webpack](https://webpack.github.io/)
  - with [Hot Module Replacement (HMR)](https://github.com/danmartinez101/babel-preset-react-hmre)
* [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/)
* [React Router](https://github.com/reactjs/react-router)
* [React Toolbox](http://react-toolbox.com)
* [Redux](http://redux.js.org)

Start using it by:
* clone it
* run `npm install`
* run `npm start`
* access it using [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)

After development is done, a build version can be created and use it by:
* run `npm run build
* run `ws -p 8080`
* access it using [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)

`ws` is a small and useful Web Server. Install it using `npm install -g local-web-server`.

Make sure you use Node version >= 4.4.3 (currently, the LTS release).

Enjoy it!
